# Kubernetes

This repository contains the Kubernetes common manifests installation and configuration for most clusters.

Each folder has its own README.md file with the specific instructions for the item you are looking for.

The Minikube folder has a simple script for managing the Minikube Cluster. You may want to check it out. The scripts will automagically install and configure common necessary features for you to quickly test kubernetes.
